# Blackjack using Reinforcement Learning

The aim of this project is to produce a Blackjack strategy using decaying epsilon-greedy Q-learning that will earn more than the average casino player.

All the code for Q-learning is in [`blackjack.py`](https://github.com/Pradhyo/blackjack/blob/master/blackjack.py).        
The notebook [`blackjack.ipynb`](https://github.com/Pradhyo/blackjack/blob/master/blackjack.ipynb) has some additional code.

To run:    
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you have support for *Jupyter Notebooks*, run the notebook `jupyter notebook blackjack.ipynb`
